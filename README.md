Hello, my name is Eric, and I'm a software developer looking to contribute and collaborate on interesting and impactful open source projects.

I've been a software developer for 6+ years, most of which has been spent in the medical device field working on next-gen portable ventilators. I recently left that field in search of new pastures and new horizons. 

There is a broad range of projects I would love to contribute to, though I am most interested in projects related to climate change, education, political fairness and empowerment, and expanding health care access in underdeveloped regions. 

Feel free to reach out: harris.eric5@gmail.com
